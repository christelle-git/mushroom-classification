# Mushroom Classification

We investigate the mushrooms classification database. 
This dataset contains 8124 instances of mushroom described by 22 features. 
The features of each mushroom are related to the physical characteristics.
Among them, the cap (shape, surface, color), gill (attachment, spacing, size, color), ring (number, type) or habitat.
Besides, each mushroom is identified as edible or poisonous.

The question is to model the classification of mushrooms as edigible to eat or poisonous.
The Classification is performed by Logistic regression and others models comparison is conducted with Cross-validation.
